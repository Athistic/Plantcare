A log in System built using PHP,html and used in conjuction with Javascript and CSS. This log in system contains a registration process,login process as well as a forgot password mechanism. The user needs to ensure that the registration form is completeted accordingly and the input data follows proper protocols. The whole log in system was built by me entirely and it is part of a website that I built along 5 other students.The website is built for people who may have an interest in agriculture and wish to grow crops. It supplies the user with the relevent information needed to grow crops. At the moment, the website only has information regarding the growth of potatoes,peppers,soinach and cabbage. To get the system to work, you first need to have a tbl_registration database where your registration data will be stored,as well as a forgotPassword that will generate a token should you forget your password. You can further add a contact_us table where you can contact the administrators of the website as well as a journey table which will record your selected crop that you wish to grow.
